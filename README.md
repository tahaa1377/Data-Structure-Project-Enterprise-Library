# Data-structure-project-Library-organization
The purpose of this project is to create a system for organizing the library. This system is implemented for the customers to use the services and the administrators to report the GTI and manage a library.
In this system, the library manager can define or remove books for the library. The information of each book will include the name of the book, the name of the author and the price.
The proposed data structure for storing these books is a tree, and the library manager has access to this tree.
